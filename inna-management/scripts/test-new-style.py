The style is characterized by its hand-drawn, slightly imperfect linework and a focus on characters with a relaxed and contemplative mood. There is a deliberate use of negative space to create a sense of calm and focus on the subject. To add visual weight and balance to the composition, incorporate one or two solid black shapes. These filled-in areas should be used thoughtfully to ground the character and anchor the scene. Typically, the largest clothing items, like pants or a jacket, or significant objects in the foreground are filled in solid black. This technique adds contrast and depth without sacrificing the overall minimalist aesthetic. The decision of what to make solid black should be based on creating a clear focal point and providing a sense of stability to the otherwise light and airy drawing.",
